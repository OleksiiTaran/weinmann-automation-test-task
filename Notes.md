1. Search field doesn't work with spaces (only one entry is working on search)
    - Search by first name
    - search by last name
    - search the both (not working)

2. Create user immediately after clickin on New button
    - Should create only when all needed entry added and Save button pressed

3. Cancel button is not removing the contact
    - Cancel button just closes the add contact dialog (should delete user instead)
